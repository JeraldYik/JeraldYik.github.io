      'I enjoy the nature & the beauty the world has to offer.\
                  I love going on treks and hikes, exploring new grounds and constantly challenging myself.\
                  As such, I joined both outdoor clubs in NTU, Singapore, as well as in UCB.\
                  These clubs provide me with the avenue to meet new people with similiar interests and the opportunities to travel to places I would not have thought of before.'

      'As a peson who likes to try new things, I have decided to pick up Martial Arts in the form of Taekwondo in high school.\
                  I religiously trained for 2 years, from a complete novice (White Belt) to a Black Belt standard.\
                  From there, I trained juniors using the expertise I have obtained from my seniors and coaches.'

      "In college, I decided to try something new. Hence, I picked up dancing as a new hobby.\
                  I started off joining a funk club in my freshman year, picking up Locking as the main genre.\
                  I religiously attended practices twice a week, 4 hours per session.\
                  With that, I improved substantially and joined competitions & showcases.\
                  For example, I was part of my college's annual Joint Dance Concert 2 years in a row, playing a valuable role in the team & aiding the choreographs whenever I can.\
                  Also, a competition I took part in was titled JuSe dance battle, in which I, as a senior, have to guide and train up my junior partner in a 2v2-style dance battle.\
                  In Berkeley, I joined AFX dance club and picked up Urban as a genre, crossing unexplored frontiers."

      'I have always been interested in Physics & Mathematics, since elementary and middle school.\
                  I have always been fascinated by numbers & how equations are cemented so elegantly and effectively.\
                  As such, I have decided to take up H3 Physics, which is a course that teaches college-level Physics in high school.\
                  I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the course, learning about abstract theories like Special Relativity & Quantum Mechanics, while fiddling with various mathematical equations & manipulations.\
                  It is with this interest that I am able to score Distinction for the national exam at the end of high school.\
                  After coming into contact with coding, I have then decided to take up Computer Science as a major instead.'

      'Intrinsically, I find joy in giving back to society & helping those in need.\
                  As such, I found myself giving free lessons twice a week to children from lower-income families, who were struggling with school work and are unable to seek additional help due to financial constraints.\
                  Such an experience was not only fulfilling, but also humbling, as I realized that there are many individuals with less-fortunate backgrounds who do not possess the right avenue to seek for help. It made me appreciate more of what I currently possess.'
