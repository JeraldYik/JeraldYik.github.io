    'Welcome to my humble portfolio. I am Jerald Yik from Singapore. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in December 2021,\
    from Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP), with a B.Sc Engineering Science (Computer Science) (Hons - Highest Distinction) & M.Sc Technology Management.\
    I am a proud receipient of the Renaissance Engineering Scholarship, only offered to the cream of the crop of the cohort.\
    I have grown very fond of Full-Stack Development, after getting my feet wet in various internship stints and personal ventures.\
    The field of Full-Stack Development is super exciting, offering many great technologies and interesting intricacies.\
    There are no lack of information, so learning is perpetual. And I love it :) \
    Also interested in Security and Blockchain Technologies, although Full-Stack Development would be my main interest.\
