    'Welcome to my humble portfolio. I am Jerald Yik from Singapore. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in December 2021,\
    from Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP), with a B.Sc Engineering Science (Computer Science) (Hons - Highest Distinction) & M.Sc Technology Management.\
    I am a proud receipient of the Renaissance Engineering Scholarship, only offered to the cream of the crop of the cohort.\
    I am currently working in Bytedance (PIPO SG: Payments) as a Backend Software Engineer.\
    Backend SWE & Fintech have been of great interest to me ever since I have embarked on this field in 2022.\
    I am also very fond of Blockchain technologies, Web3 & Crypto. Being in the fintech field has given me a lot of opportunities to explore the Web3 world, as well as noticing the similarities between Web2 & Web3, and how to bridge these two industries together.\
    I have been very active in exploring the Web3 world during my own free time.\
    Please take your time to explore this site, to learn all about me! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è'
